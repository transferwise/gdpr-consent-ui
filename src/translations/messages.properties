It might also include financial information - like your credit or debit card details, or information about your bank account.

consent.page.what.data.collect.content.p2: <h5>The regulatory stuff</h5>If you're sending a large amount of money, or we need you to make sure we're following anti money laundering regulations, we might need to see proof of your income, or some extra ID. And if you run a business, we might need some extra commercial information - like records that show how your business makes its money.
consent.page.what.data.collect.content.p3: <h5>The techy stuff</h5>We might collect information about the kind of device you're using - like whether it's a phone, a laptop, or a tablet, and where in the world you're using it.

consent.page.why.we.collect.data.title: Why we collect your data
consent.page.why.we.collect.data.desc: There are few different reasons for collecting your data. Click here to run through some of the main ones.
consent.page.why.we.collect.data.content.p1: <b>Performance of contract:</b> We have to collect some data in order to give you a service - your name and bank details, for instance. This is called 'performance of contract'. If we didn't collect this data, we wouldn't be able to send your money.
consent.page.why.we.collect.data.content.p2: <b>Legal obligation:</b> We have to collect some of your data by law. This is called a 'legal obligation'.
consent.page.why.we.collect.data.content.p3: <b>Legitimate interest:</b> This means we can collect and use your data for legitimate business reasons, in a way that most people would think was reasonable. For instance, if you signed up to TransferWise and gave us your email address, you might reasonably assume we'd use it to update you about your account activity. Or, that we'd use it to send you information about our products and services that could help you get the most out of TransferWise. You can opt out of receiving emails like this whenever you want by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link. You'll find it at the bottom of every email.
consent.page.why.we.collect.data.content.p4: <b>Consent:</b> This means that you give us permission to collect and use some of your data for a specific reason. You can withdraw consent whenever you want.

consent.page.how.we.share.data.title: How we share your information
consent.page.how.we.share.data.desc: Some of our partners need your data to complete your transfers. So we share it with them. If we didn't do that, we wouldn't be able to send your money.
consent.page.how.we.share.data.content.p1: Depending on how you use TransferWise, these partners might include other companies in the TransferWise group, banks, subcontractors, and the other financial services we work with to get your money where it needs to be.
consent.page.how.we.share.data.content.p2: We might also share some of your anonymised data with advertisers. We do this to make sure that you see adverts about the things you're interested in when you're online. We might also share your data with analytics and search engine providers. This helps us improve our website and apps, and give you a better service.
consent.page.how.we.share.data.content.p3: <b><i>In most instances, and whenever possible, we anonymise your data before it's used in this way.</i></b>

consent.page.international.data.transfers.desc: So that you can use TransferWise, we sometimes need to transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area. For example, one of TransferWise's Support Centers is in America. And so that our people there can give you the best service, we need to share your data with them.
consent.page.international.data.transfers.content: In cases like this, TransferWise has contracts in place that make sure your data is treated and safeguarded in exactly the same way as it is in the EEA.
consent.page.your.rights.title: Your rights
consent.page.your.rights.desc: You can ask to see the information we have about you. You can also ask us to change it, correct it, delete it, restrict how we use it, or object to the way we use it by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@transferwise.com">privacy@transferwise.com</a>.
